By: `Team M11-3`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites
The following are some prerequisites required:

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
Follow the steps below to set up the project:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup
Follow the steps below to verify the setup:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforEventHandler.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Flash Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Flash Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::togglefeature[]
=== Toggle feature
==== Current Implementation
The toggling feature is mainly facilitated by 2 classes, `NextCommand` and `PreviousCommand`. For either commands to work, `SelectCommand` is first executed to retrieve the choice of `Index` of the flashcard to begin toggling.
Following that, `NextCommand` or `PreviousCommand` can be called interchangeably to toggle the flashcard being displayed in the rightmost panel.

For `NextCommand`, the following operations are implemented:

* `NextCommand#getNextIndex(Index index)` -- retrieves the current flash card's Index from `SelectCommand` class.
* `NextCommand#setNextIndex(Index index, int start)` --  pass the index currently being used in `NextCommand` to `PreviousCommand`.

Similarly, for `PreviousCommand`, the following operations are implemented:

* `PreviousCommand#getPreviousIndex(Index index)` -- retrieves the current flash card's Index from `SelectCommand` class.
* `PreviousCommand#setPreviousIndex(Index index, int start)` -- pass the index currently being used in `PreviousCommand` to `NextCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of `SelectCommand` and how the index will be passed to both `NextCommand` and `PreviousCommand` class.

image::selectCommandSD.png[width="800"]

After `SelectCommand` is being called, `NextCommand` or `PreviousCommand` can be called interchangeably. +

The sequence diagram belows illustrates the execution of `NextCommand` and how the index value will be passed to `PreviousCommand` class. +

image::NextCommandSD.png[width="800"]

To execute toggling of next flashcard, execute the following commands: +

1) `select 2` [2 is just an example, choose index of choice] +
2) `next` +
Flashcard with next 3 will be displayed for the example above. +

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of `PreviousCommand` and how the index value will be passed to `NextCommand` class. +

image::PreviousCommandSD.png[width="800"]

To execute toggling of previous flashcard, execute the following commands: +

1) `select 2` [2 is just an example, choose index of choice] +
2) `previous` +
Flashcard with next 1 will be displayed for the example above. +

An example scenario of selecting the flashcard (Step 1) and executing the next or previous after select (Step 2) or otherwise (Step 3) is shown below. +

===== Step 1: Selecting a Flashcard
1. Executing a `select INDEX` command. +
2. The `INDEX` will be passed into Next Command, facilitated by `getNextIndex()` in NextCommand class. In NextCommand class, `nextIndex` will be initiated
with `INDEX+1` to obtain the index number of the next flashcard. +
3. The `INDEX` will also be passed into Previous Command, facilitated by `getPreviousIndex()` in PreviousCommand class. In PreviousCommand class, the `previousIndex` will be initiated
with `INDEX-1` to obtain the index number of the previous flashcard. +

===== Step 2: Executing next or previous after select
The following is an execution of NextCommand:

1. As mentioned in step 1, `nextIndex` has been initiated with the index obtain through Select command.
2. When NextCommand is called, the `nextIndex` will be passed into Previous Command, facilitated by `setPreviousIndex()` in PreviousCommand class.
In PreviousCommand class, the `previousIndex` will now be replaced by `nextIndex -1` to obtain the index number of the previous flashcard.
3. Lastly nextCommand will set the flashcard of `nextIndex`, facilitated by setSelectedFlashcard() in model.
4. Thereafter, next or previous can be called interchangeably without having to select a flashcard.

The following is an execution of PreviousCommand:

1. As mentioned in step 1, `previousIndex` has been initiated with the index obtain through Select command.
2. When PreviousCommand is called, the `previousIndex` will be passed into Next Command, facilitated by `setNextIndex()` in NextCommand class.
In NextCommand class, the `nextIndex` will now be replaced by `previousIndex+1` to obtain the index number of the next flashcard.
3. Lastly PreviousCommand will set flashcard of `previousIndex`, facilitated by setSelectedFlashcard() in model.
4. Thereafter, next or previous can be called interchangeably without having to select a flashcard.


==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Obtain the index after select command.
** Pros: Easy to implement and convenient for the user.
** Cons: Have to manually select the first card to choose from.
* **Alternative 2:** Toggling will begin from the first index.
** Pros: Saves the user the step of having to select the index of choice.
** Cons: Might be too troublesome for some users who wants to being from a flashcard index that is large.


// end::togglefeature[]

// tag::quizzingbysubject[]
=== Quizzing by Subject
A subject that is selected will have all the flashcards pertaining to it shown.
This mode will help users focus on a specific subject before their tests/exams/quizzes.

==== Current Implementation
The FlashCards UI is divided into three panels from left to right – Subjects, Flashcards, and Content. +

* Subjects Panel (facilitated by `SubjectListPanel`): +
Displays:
** Subject tag

* Flashcards Panel (facilitated by `FlashcardListPanel`): +
Displays information in this order:
** Topic of flashcard
** Difficulty level of flashcard
** (Optional) Deadline to memorize flashcard
** Subject tag displayed as a coloured tag

* Content Panel (facilitated by `RightPanel`): +
This panel is further sectioned into 2:
** Topic of flashcard
** Content of flashcard

Upon adding a flashcard with the `add` command, (e.g. `add t/Pythagoras Theorem diff/1 c/a^2 + b^2 = c^2 s/Math`),
the subject tag "Math" will be added to a `SubjectBook` and `UniqueSubjectList` before being displayed in the `SubjectListPanel`. +

An example scenario of adding a flashcard (Step 1) and displaying the flashcards for each subject (Step 2) is shown below.

===== Step 1: Adding a Flashcard
There are 2 possible cases when adding a flashcard:

1. *Subject tag is unique among other flashcards* +
The Subject tag will be added to the `UniqueSubjectList` object.
+
Shown below is the adding mechanism of a flashcard with a unique subject among other flashcards is added: +
+
* Each time a flashcard is added using the Logic component's `AddCommand()`, the adding will be facilitated by `addSubject()` in the Model component.
+
* The Model component's `addSubject()` will use `SubjectBook` 's `addSubject()` to add the subject to a list containing only unique subjects.
+
* `SubjectBook` will create a `UniqueSubjectList` object that stores all unique subjects.
+
* The `UniqueSubjectList` object will invoke its `addSubject()` function. This function will check if the current `UniqueSubjectList` object contains the subject tag of the current flashcard to be added.
Since it is unique in this scenario, the subject tag of the current flashcard will be added to this `UniqueSubjectList` object.
+
* The `SubjectListPanel` then displays this newly added subject.
+

2. *Subject tag already exists in other flashcards* +
No Subject tag is added to the `UniqueSubjectList` object.
+
Shown below is the adding mechanism of a flashcard whose subject already exists in other flashcards is added:
+
* Each time a flashcard is added using the Logic component's `AddCommand()`, the adding will be facilitated by `addSubject()` in the Model component.
+
* The Model component's `addSubject()` will use `SubjectBook` 's `addSubject()` to add the subject to a list containing only unique subjects.
+
* `SubjectBook` will create a `UniqueSubjectList` object that stores all unique subjects.
+
* The `UniqueSubjectList` object will invoke its `addSubject()` function. This function will check if the current `UniqueSubjectList` object contains the subject tag of the current flashcard to be added.
Since it is not unique in this scenario, the subject tag *will not* be added to the `UniqueSubjectList` object.
+
* The `SubjectListPanel` remains unchanged.


The following sequence diagram summarises what happens in this Step 1: +

image::SubjectQuizzingFeature-addSubject.png[width="800"]
Figure: Sequence Diagram of successfully adding a flashcard +

* Blue: -- Logic and Model component
* Yellow -- JavaFX component


===== Step 2: Displaying Flashcards According to Subjects
After a flashcard is added, the following sequence of events will happen:

* The UI component's `MainWindow` will create a new `SubjectListPanel` object that takes in and invokes:

** Logic component's `getFilteredSubjectList()` -- returns `filteredSubjects` which contains a list of unique subjects
** Logic component's `selectedSubjectProperty()` -- returns the `selectedSubject` tag clicked by the user
** Logic component's `setSelectedSubject()` -- replaces previously selected subject with the newly selected subject

* In `SubjectListPanel`, `setItems()` and `setCellFactory()` of JavaFX will populate the panel with the unique subject list from `getFilteredSubjectList()`.

* The UI component's `MainWindow` will create a new `FlashcardListPanel` object that takes in and invokes:

** Logic component's `getFilteredFlashcardList()` -- returns `filteredFlashcards` which contains a list of unique flashcards
** Logic component's `selectedSubjectProperty()` -- returns the `selectedSubject` tag clicked by the user

* In `FlashcardListPanel`, `setItems()` and `setCellFactory()` of JavaFX will populate the panel with the unique flashcard list from `getFilteredFlashcardList()`.

* A listener is attached to the `selectedSubjectProperty` value passed into `FlashcardListPanel` in order to detect if another subject is selected.

* When a new subject is selected, `FlashcardListPanel` invokes `updateFlashcardList()`.
It matches the subject tag of flashcards from `getFilteredFlashcardList()` with the newly selected subject.
If the subject tag matches, this flashcard is added to a `newFlashcardList`.

* The flashcard panel is then populated with flashcards from `newFlashcardList` using `setItems()` and `setCellFactory()` of JavaFX.


The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens in Step 2: +

image::SubjectQuizzingFeature-UI.png[width="800"]
Figure: Sequence Diagram of displaying flashcards according to subject +

* Purple -- UI component
* Blue -- Model component
* Yellow -- JavaFX component

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: When to add a unique subject to the `UniqueSubjectList` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if subject is unique in `addSubject()` of `UniqueSubjectList`
** Pros: Supports code reusability.
** Cons: More tedious to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Check if subject is unique in `AddCommand()`
** Pros: Easy to implement and faster way of checking.
** Cons: Does not support code reusability.

===== Aspect: Populating subjects list on application start up
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Populate the subject list after the flashcard list is populated
** Pros: No need additional storage for subject list
** Cons: Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Populate subject list using what was stored in `SubjectBook`
** Pros: Easy to implement. Populates subject list the same way as how flashcard list is populated.
** Cons: Need to create additional storage for subject list.

===== Aspect: Displaying subject name as a text label or a coloured subject tag
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Text label
** Pros: Easier to implement and UI is not overly colourful which makes it easier for users' eyes to adapt.
** Cons: Inconsistency when displaying subject (i.e. plain text in `SubjectListPanel` but coloured tag in `FlashcardListPanel`).
* **Alternative 2:** Coloured subject tag
** Pros: More consistency when displaying subject in `SubjectListPanel` and `FlashcardListPanel`.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Might also be harsher on the users' eyes and they might not know where to focus on.

// end::quizzingbysubject[]

=== Quizzing by Difficulty
This mode will be largely focused on viewing flashcard based on a chosen difficulty. Flashcards are added with a difficulty level set by the user. The difficulty level can be toggled in this mode for the user to focus more on difficult concepts or easier concepts. This mode can be used along side `"Subject" Testing Mode` to get a further filtered list of flashcards with both chosen subject and difficulty.

==== Current Implementation
This mode of quizzing is facilitated by `SortCommand`. This command filters all the flashcard with the same difficulty level. +
When a flashcard is added, user must input a difficulty level 1 (easy), 2 (medium) or 3 (difficult) for each flashcard. +
The `SortCommand` will help students to focus on one chosen difficulty level, helping them prioritize their time well.

The sequence diagram below illustrate how `SortCommand` is executed.

image::SortCommandSD.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters flashcard and displays all flashcard with chosen difficulty.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Only get to see flashcards under 1 difficulty level.
* **Alternative 2:** Displays flashcards in ascending or descending difficulty level.
** Pros: Can view more flashcards at once.
** Cons: Difficult to implement.

=== Shelf-Life of FlashCards
==== Current Implementation

The user can determine how long the flash cards will exist in the database “FlashCards”.
The following operations are available:

* `FlashCards#clearall()` -- Clears the entire database.
* `FlashCards#clear()` -- Clears a specific flashcard when in "Subject" Knowledge Testing Mode.
* `FlashCards#deadline()` or `FlashCards#exam()` -- Adds a deadline/exam for the specified flashcard.

For easier modes of implementation, the user can also choose to set a date whereby the flash cards would be unavailable thereafter. To activate this function, the user can type in `deadline` or `exam`, followed by the index and the date. For example, in the event where the user knows the specific exam date for the selected flashcard, he/she can set the exam date under the “Subject Details” and the flash cards will be available for another month after the exam before the auto deletion function is activated.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#clearall()`, `Logic#clear()`, `Logic#deadline()` and `Logic#exam()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the deadline/exam mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFlashCards` will be initialized with the initial flash card state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single flash card state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `list` command to list all the available flashcards in the FlashCards. The `list` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the flash card after the `list` command executes to be saved in the `flashCardStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted flash card state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `deadline 1 d/...` or `exam 1 d/...` to add a new deadline or exam date for the specified flashcard. The `deadline` command also calls `Model#commitFlashBook()`, causing another modified flash book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFlashBook()`, so the flash book state will not be saved into the `flashBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that the deadline/exam is over and do not wish to save the flashcard in the flash card. By executing the `clear` command, he can delete all the respective flash cards under the specified flashcard. The `clear` command will call `Logic#Clear()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous flash card state, and clear all the respective flash cards of the specified flashcard.

Step 5: Alternatively, the user can execute the `clearall` command which will delete all the flash cards in the FlashCards. The `clearall` command will call `Logic#Clearall()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous flash card state, and clear all the respective flash cards in FlashCards.

image::undoredoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial flash book state, then there are no previous flash book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the flash book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest flash book state, then there are no undone flash book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the flash book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all flash book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How deadline/exam executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Auto deletion of the flash cards.
** Pros: Easy to implement and convenient for the user.
** Cons: Need to have additional internal calendar for the auto deletion.
* **Alternative 2:** Manual deletion of the flash cards.
** Pros: Allow the user to have the choice of keeping the flash cards or removing it.
** Cons: Might be troublesome for some users.

Alternative 1 is chosen to prevent overloading of overdue flashcards, which will take up excess storage if the user does not manually delete.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the deadline/exam commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement an internal calendar to calculate the number of days left.
** Pros: Auto deletion of flash cards.
** Cons: Need to pay extra caution for Leap years.
* **Alternative 2:** Use the `clear` or `clearall` function to manually delete.
** Pros: Give the user the choice to keep or delete.
** Cons: Might be troublesome for some users.

Alternative 1 is chosen to prevent overloading of overdue flashcards, which will take up excess storage if the user does not manually delete.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Flash Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all flashcards in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the flash book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the flash book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a flashcard, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each flashcard, and remove the `tag` from each flashcard.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your flash book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last flashcard in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside flashcard cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.subjectName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the flash book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of flashcards when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of flashcards whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of flashcards status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the flash book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the flash book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the flash book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the flash book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/FlashBookStorage.java[`FlashBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonFlashBookStorage.java[`JsonFlashBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `flashbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a flashcard specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first flashcard to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first flashcard.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each flashcard later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Flashcard` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the flashcard will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Flashcard` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Flashcard` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the flashcard that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Flashcard` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Flashcard
` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a flashcard.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
