== Introduction

FlashCards is for those who *prefer to use a desktop application to manage their notes*.
More importantly, FlashCards is *optimized for those who are comfortable working with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With FlashCards, you no longer need to worry about sieving through your hard copied notes for various subjects just to find the ones you want.
You can have all your notes categorized neatly in one platform and be easily accessible at your fingertips!

Read on to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashcard.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for this FlashCard application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Other example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all flashcards
* **`add`**`t/Pythagoras Theorem diff/1 c/a^2 + b^2 = c^2 d/30-03-2019 s/Math`

Adds a flashcard named `Pythagoras Theorem` under the subject `Math` to the list of flashcards.
It has a difficulty level of `1` with the content `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` and should be memorised by `30-03-2019`.

* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd flashcard shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
