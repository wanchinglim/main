== PROJECT: FlashCards

---

== Overview
FlashCards is a desktop flashcard consolidation application for students to compile and organise notes for different subjects.
It provides an easy way to have a simple way to store different notes
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Toggle feature*
** What it does: It allows the user to navigate between flashcard easily with a next and previous command.
** Justification: This feature improves the navigation process for viewing the flashcard. Instead of always selecting a flashcard by index, users can just command next or previous to toggle through the flashbook.
** Highlights:  This enhancement is designed to work with other commands as well as other commands that will be added in the future. It incorporates algorithms and operating styles thought in this module.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Sort feature*
** What it does: It allows the user to view all flashcards of a certain difficulty.
** Justification: This feature provides a filtered flashbook for users to focus on only reading flashcards with selected difficulty. This commands also allows users to search for flashcards of that difficulty.
** Highlights:  This enhancement is designed to work with other commands as well as other commands that will be added in the future. It focuses mainly on the logic and model segment of the code to produce the desired outcome. I had to use various Java built-in libraries to achieve this.
** Credits: This code was inspired by the find command that was provided in address book 4.


* *Minor enhancement*: Added a status bar for total number of flashcards that the flashbook contains.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a `selectSubject` command to allow users to choose the subject.
